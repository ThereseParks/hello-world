# hello-world
just my first repository
I am a softmore in a B.S. program specializing in software development. So far, I have acquired basic skills in HTML, CSS, and JAVA and 
I am currently seeking new challenges that can put these skills to use, while gaining experience and courage. I am ready to get my hands 
dirty, and make whatever mistakes are inevitable in order to become a master programmer.
